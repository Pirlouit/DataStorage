# DataStorage
This is the source code from the NuGet package 'DataStorage'. This package makes it really easy to store data within Azure without database. Instead, it uses the blob storage file system as a SGBD. It aims to help developpers to create some PoCs very quickly. The library is definitely not recommended for production purpose.  
> The package has not been released yet on [Nuget.org](https://www.nuget.org/) because it is not stable enough yet.
